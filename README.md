Static Composition #1 (Turing: Mod 1)

**Project Scope**

The aim of this project was to recreate a static composition provided through our instructor with no native files at our disposal. We were to maintain the overall layout, but had creative liberties in terms of copy, images, icons, and color, so long as we made sure to use a complimentary color theme. The challenge required us to make the site responsive as well, with the layout adapting to various screen sizes. However, a responsive layout composition was not provided for us, only a desktop layout, and we were assumed to use our best judgement in regards to responsiveness. The first image below is the original layout, followed by my re-interpritation.

In my version of the layout, I used Rick Sanchez from the TV show *Rick and Morty* as my subject. Overall, it's a mock-version of the traditional artist's portfolio website, consisting of tabs for *Planets Destroyed* and *Weak Feelings*, which depicts his grandson, Morty's, face. The icons consist of a few I sourced through the internet, while most I made myself in Photoshop. The color pallete comes directly from the profile image on the right-most side of the web page, but is more subdued to mimic the original composition challenge. Additionally, hover effects have been added to all of the square boxes and the buttons over the profile image to make the site a bit more immersive.

For the responsive layout, I moved the profile image to the top in a landscape layout and placed the other 'profile boxes' beneath it. Due to the arrangement of my original boxes, I had two yellow ones that blended into one another, so I re-ordered them to maintain a more cohesive color scheme. For the empty space at the bottom-right corner, I added a floating image of Rick so the void was more interesting when seen on the mobile layout.
