Static Composition #1 (Turing: Mod 1)

**Project Scope**

The aim of this project was to recreate a static composition provided through our instructor with no native files at our disposal. We were to maintain the overall layout, but had creative liberties in terms of copy, images, icons, and color, insofar as we made sure to use a complimentary color theme. The challenge required us to make the site responsive as well, with the layout adapting to various screen sizes. However, a responsive layout was not provided for us, only a desktop layout, and we were assumed to use our best judgement. The first image below is the original layout, followed by my re-interpritation.
